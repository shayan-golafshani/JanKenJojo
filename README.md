# jan-ken-po
This is your favorite classic game of all time!

This game is named after the Japanese version of the game that children in schoolyards all over Japan use to settle disputes. After one game of jan-ken, as it's lovingly shortened to. You can just forget what ever you were worried about.

## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html) of this group project that was made for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game completely from from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JS
2. using localStorage to persist data
3. finessing event delegation to handle similar event listeners
4. understanding the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
5. iterating/ filtering through DOM elements with for loops.
6. understanding the interaction between multiple class files
7. using my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to come up with an answer.


## Features
* A website that allows users to play two different games fo rock, paper, scissors. The first game is the classic game, and the user can click and select a hand to throw. The computer throws back a generated hand, and both choices are briefly displayed on the screen. Afterwards, the user can change games, using the change game button, which has the logic rules describing the selectable fighters. The game is themed after [Jojo's Bizarre Adventures Anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure).
* Classic game
* Jojo-themed game
* Ability to change buttons

## Project Reflection

##### Wins
* I got the game functioning and saving wins with local storage.
* Created JoJo-themed styling with CSS.
* Gained a better understanding of class to class interactions and
how to use class methods.

##### Challenges
* The timer was the most challenging, and learning to implement users input to the timer accordingly.  
* Retrieving local storage and displaying on DOM.

##### Overall Impressions
* I'm proud of my work, it works!
* I could try to come up with an article explaining the character logic.
* I learned how to work independently without referencing outside sources.
* Also learned that it's good to get done early, so that I can set aside time and energy for refactoring and improving my code to make it more easily understood.

#### Future Features
* Add sounds playing!
